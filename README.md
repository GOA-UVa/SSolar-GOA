## Developer notes

Some short notes regarding the commits to the git repository:

* Use short commit titles, no more than 50 characters.
* Write commit titles starting with capital letter and in imperative form, e.g. "Add" instead of "Added", "Fix" instead of "Fixed".
* If the commit title is too short to describe the global modifications done by the commit, add a description paragraph after the commit title (leave a blank line in between).
* If possible, avoid the use of tab characters and replace them with four space characters, to avoid mixtures of tabs and spaces through the files. This can also be configured in the settings of various editors.
