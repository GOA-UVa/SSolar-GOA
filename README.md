# python-solo

This library stores the Python implementation of UVa-GOA radiative transfer model developed by the Group of Atmospheric Optics from University of Valladolid.

## Installation notes

This library requires Python >= 2.7+ or Python >= 3.3 and NumPy >= 1.10. To install it, download the library, open a console in the folder where ``setup.py`` is located and type:

python setup.py install

In case that admin privileges are required, use the same command preceded by ``sudo``.

## Developer notes

Some short notes regarding the commits to the git repository:

* Use short commit titles, no more than 50 characters.
* Write commit titles starting with capital letter and in imperative form, e.g. "Add" instead of "Added", "Fix" instead of "Fixed".
* If the commit title is too short to describe the global modifications done by the commit, add a description paragraph after the commit title (leave a blank line in between).
* If possible, avoid the use of tab characters and replace them with four space characters, to avoid mixtures of tabs and spaces through the files. This can also be configured in the settings of various editors.
